class BaseRobot:
    """
    BaseRobot provides a comprehensive set of methods and attributes for \
        controlling an FLL Team 24277 robot using the pybricks library.
    This class abstracts common robot operations such as driving, turning, \
        and manipulating attachments, as well as color detection and user \
        input handling. It is designed to simplify mission programming and \
        ensure consistent robot behavior.
    Features:
    - Initializes motors, sensors, and color profiles for reliable operation.
    - Provides high-level movement commands (drive, turn, curve, arc) with \
        support for speed, acceleration, and gyro control.
    - Includes methods for precise control of left and right attachment \
        motors (by degrees, time, or until stalled).
    - Supports color detection with custom HSV profiles for robust field \
        color recognition.
    - Offers utility methods for waiting (delays, button presses) to \
        synchronize robot actions with user input or field events.
    - Allows easy mapping between custom color profiles and pybricks default \
        colors for hub light feedback.
    Example usage:
        >>> from base_robot import *
        >>> br = BaseRobot()
        >>> br.driveForDistance(distance=200, speedPct=80)
        >>> br.moveLeftAttachmentMotorForDegrees(degrees=90)
    Attributes:
        hub (PrimeHub): The main hub object for robot control.
        leftDriveMotor (Motor): Motor controlling the left drive wheel.
        rightDriveMotor (Motor): Motor controlling the right drive wheel.
        robot (DriveBase): DriveBase object for coordinated driving.
        leftAttachmentMotor (Motor): Motor for the left attachment.
        rightAttachmentMotor (Motor): Motor for the right attachment.
        colorSensor (ColorSensor): Color sensor for field color detection.
        sensorColors (list[Color]): List of custom color profiles detectable \
            by the color sensor.
        myColor2DefaultColorDict (dict[Color, Color]): Mapping from custom \
            color profiles to pybricks default colors.
    Note:
        - All movement methods accept optional parameters for speed, \
            acceleration, and waiting for completion.
        - Color profiles should be calibrated for your specific field and \
            lighting conditions.
        - Use the provided snippet names (e.g., 'dfd', 'lmd') for quick code \
            insertion in compatible editors.
